id = "mover1">Medusae Nilfisk-<br>

The public interacts with the Medusae Nilfisk light cycles and flamethrowers through a collaborative effort, creating contact between the two poles. When people join hand or establish another physical connection, it is registered by the control systems and ignites the gas explosions. A build in timer set a limit to the amount of explosions in succession.

The former Narva bulb factory represents the failure of the eastern economy and new developments located on its former grounds, such as the glass tower, are symbolic for the processes that shape the Berlin of today. Omnivisu seeks to ask about the role of a city’s inhabitants within these developments.

Everyone who visited placeastone.nl between June 2015 and March 2016 was invited to add one small stone, and to replace one small stone per name. As a result the typeface was continually growing and shifting.
Starting as a single row of small stones, the typeface expanded with the burgeoning number of participants.

More and more stones were placed and replaced, and more decisions were made ➝ where can a letter be bigger, or fatter, or how can a letter become more readable? By being allowed to place only one stone and replacing another, the typeface transformed ceaselessly in the course of nine months.

It continues to feel new and is used in new ways each year by students, who have used the site to share events, publicize work, register protest, 			plan exhibitions, and start unofficial courses. <br><br>In 2007, the website received the AIGA “365” Award. In 2010 it was declared “the year’s 		suckiest website” by Vincent Flanders. In 2012 it was featured as part of Linked by Air’s Jury Award in the Brno Graphic Design 											Biennial. Here is an interesting review from 2016.

But how do we build those alternatives? What do their implementations look like, and how do we address their technical and ethical challenges in the face of increasing user adoption?
